UAE law mandates the use of helmets, availability of the red rear light and reflector, and a headlight.

## In the Traffic

Article 16 of the Traffic Law indicates that riders must stay on the road’s right side and should never ride their bicycles on pavements. Furthermore, if there is a designated cycle track, cyclists must stay on it and not leave unless it is absolutely necessary. Also, cyclists are required to ride in a single line, one after the other.

Cyclists are not allowed to take the assistance of automobiles for pulling or dragging their cycles as well as transporting people. The only case in which they can do this is when the cycles are fitted for the purpose of being dragged.

As per Article 17, riding a bicycle without holding the steering rod or just sticking to it by one hand is prohibited in the UAE.

Cyclists in the UAE must also take care of the speed and should always drive within the maximum speed limit. In the UAE, this limit is 40 km/h unless the road has a dedicated track for cycling.

According to the Department of Traffic at Dubai Police, riding bicycles is not permitted on most of the roads with a speed limit of 60km per hour except the Jumeirah Road, which has a cycling track. Cyclists found riding on roads with speed limits of 60km/h or greater may be fined up to AED 600.
