description: **Chapter 1: How to Get a Bike at NYUAD**

1. **Student Bike Share Program**  
   NYUAD offers a weekly bike share program. The sign-up link is posted every Tuesday on the Student Portal. Selection is random. If selected, you can pick up the bike from the **B2 parking bike storage room** on Thursday and must return it the following Tuesday.  
   - **Rule:** Students selected for a bike cannot reapply the next week.  
   - **Lifehack:** If you need a bike during someone else’s turn, you can borrow a friend’s bike (with their consent) or apply on their behalf using their name.

2. **Purchasing a Bike**  
   - The **closest shop** is located inside the NYUAD campus, next to West Parking. Bikes are priced around **AED 1,000** and can be purchased with Falcon Dirhams.  
   - For a wider selection, visit **Decathlon at Yas Mall** or other bike shops in Abu Dhabi malls.

3. **Renting a Bike**  
   - Several rental options are available around Abu Dhabi. Services like bike-sharing stations or rental shops in tourist areas offer flexible plans for short-term use.
